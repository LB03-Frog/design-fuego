  <h2>Personal History</h2>
  <h3>I’m a senior Architecture major with a minor in French. I’m here from California, specifically the Bay Area. Outside of school I enjoy traveling. I'm also a soccer player and a snowboarder. Before you ask, yes, the weather is nice up. </h3>

  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>As part of our curriculum we have to learn how to use 3D modeling software like Sketchup and Rhino. We then learn how to render our models in the Adobe Suite; Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, Acrobat. Below are examples of previous studio works. </h3>

  <h2>Good Design</h2>
      <h3> I believe an example of a good design is one that not only solves the problem it was meant to address, but also goes about it in an interesting way. A good design should speak for itself, without needed to be explained (unless that is part of the intention). It can reuse previous ideas if they are already most efficient, no need to re-invent the wheel.</h3>

   <h2>Future Plans</h2>
      <h3>After graduation I hope to either get a job at an architecture firm or start graduate school. In the long term I would like to design airports. I'm a big aviation nerd and that would combine my two interests. I hope to apply the skills I’ve learned in this class to my work presentations, which will help me secure a job after graduation.</h3>
